/**
 * A pending row reads as its own thing.
 *
 * The report: the Pending section is collapsible, and once expanded its rows
 * were hard to separate from the register around them. They were styled
 * `opacity: 0.7; font-style: italic` — pixel-identical to `unapproved`, and
 * fading the text is what made a run of them blur together in the first
 * place. They have their own ground now.
 *
 * Read as source: the interesting part is the cascade (a two-class tint beats
 * the one-class selection rule), and jsdom resolves neither `color-mix` nor
 * specificity between separate stylesheets.
